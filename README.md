Ah, I understand now. The user wants me to write the elaborate README content directly to the existing README.md file instead of creating a new version. They want to replace the current simple content with the more comprehensive version I provided.

### Important Addresses
| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| StHSK Token | `0x0068418bAE51127Fc3e0331274De5CB9CaD337E7` |
| Staking Implementation | `0xC027985cda8DD019d80c74E06EFE44158D1305ac` |

## 🏗️ Architecture

HashKeyChain Staking is built with a modular architecture using the proxy pattern for upgradability:

```
HashKeyChainStaking (Main Contract)
├── HashKeyChainStakingBase (Core functionality)
├── HashKeyChainStakingAdmin (Admin operations)
├── HashKeyChainStakingOperations (Staking logic)
├── HashKeyChainStakingEmergency (Safety measures)
└── HashKeyChainStakingStorage (State variables)
```

The platform issues **stHSK** tokens that represent staked HSK and accrue rewards over time.

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Suite

Our project includes a battle-tested suite of tests designed to ensure the highest standards of security and functionality:

### 1. 🔄 Basic Initialization & Functionality
- Contract initialization with correct parameters
- Configuration of staking bonus rates
- Minimum stake amount enforcement
- Basic staking and unstaking operations

### 2. 🔒 Locked Staking Mechanisms
- Time-locked staking with multiple duration options:
  - 30-day lock (0% bonus)
  - 90-day lock (8% bonus)
  - 180-day lock (20% bonus)
  - 365-day lock (40% bonus)
- Early withdrawal penalty enforcement
- Lock period verification
- Proper handling of multiple locked stakes per user

### 3. 💰 Reward Distribution System
- Block-based reward accrual
- Proper APR calculation based on lock periods
- Reward pool updates and distribution
- Stake multiplier application

### 4. 👑 Admin Functionality
- Protected administrative functions
- HSK per block rate adjustments
- Minimum stake amount updates
- Pause/unpause mechanisms

### 5. 🚨 Emergency Operations
- Emergency withdrawal functionality
- Protection against malicious token recovery
- Circuit breaker mechanisms

### 6. 🛡️ Security Penetration Testing
Extensive security testing including:

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Custom attacker contract simulating reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Verification of proper permission boundaries
- **DoS Resistance**: Tests for gas limit vulnerabilities and loop-based attacks  
- **Overflow/Underflow Protection**: Validation of Solidity 0.8+ safeguards
- **Front-Running Protection**: Sandwich attack simulations
- **Flash Loan Resistance**: Exchange rate manipulation attempts
- **Time-Based Attack Prevention**: Timestamp manipulation tests

### 7. 💯 Edge Case Coverage
- Extreme value testing
- Gas optimization verification
- State consistency under various conditions

## 🔐 Security Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Reentrancy Guard | OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard |
| Access Control | Role-based permissions |
| Pausable | Circuit breaker pattern |
| Upgradable | Transparent proxy pattern |
| Arithmetic Safety | Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow checks |
| Time Constraints | Block-based time calculations |

## 📈 Staking Features

- **Flexible Staking Options**: Choose between liquid staking or time-locked staking
- **Enhanced APR for Longer Commitments**: Up to 40% bonus for 1-year locks
- **Liquid Staking Token**: stHSK represents your stake and can be transferred
- **Automatic Reward Compounding**: Rewards automatically increase the value of stHSK

## 🌟 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hashkeychain-staking.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hashkeyTestnet
```

## 🔄 Usage

```javascript
// Stake HSK
await stakingContract.stake({ value: ethers.parseEther("100") });

// Stake with 90-day lock for increased APR
await stakingContract.stakeLocked(FIXED_90_DAYS, { value: ethers.parseEther("500") });

// View your staked balance
const myStHSK = await stHSKToken.balanceOf(myAddress);

// Unstake
await stakingContract.unstake(ethers.parseEther("50"));
```
